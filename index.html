            <p class='second-p'>I was born in Chungju, South Korea, however I became a Canadian Citizen when I was in grade 10. I have completed my part-time studies at bcit for ACIS and ADAD certificates. I am currently in the <b>ACIT</b> program, which I very much enjoy and it will help prepare for my future career in the IT field. Web-dev is also one of my favourite course. My hobby is playing the acoustic guitar and would <em>have</em> to learn piano later.</p>
