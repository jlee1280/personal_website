    <h1>Jimmy Lee</h1>
    

<p>My name is Jeong Hoon Lee, but I prefer to be
called,<strong>Jimmy</strong>. I was born in Chungju, South Korea, however I became a Canadian Citizen when I was in grade 10. I have completed my part-time studies at bcit
for ACIS and ADAD certificates. I am currently in the <b>ACIT</b>program, which I
very much enjoy and it will help prepare for my future career in the IT field. Web-dev is also one of my favourite course.
My hobby is playing the acoustic guitar and would <em>like to learn</em>piano later.
